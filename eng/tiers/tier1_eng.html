            During "perestroika", television broadcasts and broadcasts promising healing from all diseases were very popular in Soviet society.

            It is an excellent indicator of how people born in the USSR, despite the high level of education, blindly trusted TV and could not (for the most part) rationally think "outside the box"

            Recently, rumors have spread that the Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin is weakened by several diseases at once, but at the same time he continues to wage a brutal war against Ukraine. Rumors about the existence of the Russian president's doubles have been circulating online for years.
            <br>
            <strong>British intelligence</strong>: "Putin is very ill, and when he dies, his death will be kept secret for weeks, if not months. There is also a possibility that he is already dead. It's impossible to know. It is believed that Putin used doppelgangers in the past when he was ill, and the Kremlin could do it now. Putin heads a small group of high-ranking officials who are completely loyal to him," they also claim that the Kremlin will specifically keep silent about Putin's death, since a coup may occur in Russia against the background of such news, and the army command will decide on the withdrawal of troops from the territory of Ukraine.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thus, adherents of the theory of doubles point to certain <strong>changes in appearance</strong> Putin, among which: a difference in the structure of the skull, a change in the cut of the eyes and the shape of the lower jaw, a displacement of the mole on the left cheek, different shapes of the earlobe and nose, as well as hair growth lines.
          </center>
          <br>
          <center>
            <strong>My Verdict:</strong>
            <br>
            I am inclined to believe that Putin really has clones. If compared by <a href="https://images.novyny.live/images/thumbnail/original/615e9a6b2ccb1-putyn-1.jpg ">Table of Putins</a>, then you can see serious changes in the shape of the face, which is impossible to fake with plastic (<em>or very problematic </em>), and since different "Putins" appeared in public in a fairly short period of time (<em>March 2015</em>) - I think it's impossible for it to be 1 person.

            <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_CSKSshWg "></a>"Lenin â€” mushroom"</strong> is a hoax television story prepared by musician Sergey Kuryokhin and journalist Sergey Sholokhov and first shown in January 1991 (<em>possibly repeated in May 1991</em>) in the television program "The Fifth Wheel" on Leningrad television. The plot is constructed in the form of an interview that Sergey Sholokhov took from Sergey Kuryokhin, representing on the one hand an attempt to ridicule the "sacred image" of Lenin, and on the other â€” a satire on pseudoscientific TV shows and reports.

    <h2>> Varum (singer) - is Agutin with an auto-tune</h2>

          <center>
            The theory that the song "Everything is in your Hands" was actually performed by Agutin has been around for several years. There are videos on YouTube, the authors of which lower Varum's voice by two tones and get a voice very similar to Agutin.
            An example with "Everything is in your hands", as well as with Varum's song "The Artist who draws Rain", Dudu was shown in 2017 by his guest, musician Neuromonk Feofan. In both tracks they heard Agutin's voice. Andrey Malakhov is also confident in the substitution.
            <br>
            Agutin himself claims that he has nothing to do with it. He explained to Dudu that the first song was recorded in 1997, and the second one was recorded back in 1991, when he was not familiar with Varum. In those days, the musician said, it was not yet possible to change the tonality of the voice without changing the speed: songs were written on tape, and raising the tonality would increase the tempo.
          </center>
          <center>
            <br>
            <strong>My Verdict:</strong>
            <br>
            Judging by various information, analysis of Varum and Agutin's songs, as well as their voices, it can be said that with great probability Agutin sang for Varum using a light autotune. However, Agutin still proves the opposite to this day.

            The Internet Research Agency (also referred to in the press and other sources as "kremlebots", "troll factory", "Prigozhin trolls", "Olginsky trolls", <strong>"lakhtobots"</strong></em>) is a Russian structure with headquartered in St. Petersburg, engaged in disinformation, the formation of public opinion, in particular the discrediting of the Russian opposition.

            A few years ago, such a question would have caused wild bewilderment, however, today, when more and more researchers are beginning to question the Tatar-Mongolian hypothesis, it is emotionally easier for us to make an effort and analyze pure facts without burdening them with established interpretations in which a series of "authorities" endlessly refer to each other, as if that in itself proves something. After all, if someone has considered a lie to be true for a very long time, it does not become truer from this.

            <strong>My Verdict (tldr;):</strong>
            <br>
            Judging from the information found, as well as logical guesses and conclusions, the conclusion suggests that the Tatar-Mongol Yoke did not exist, but in fact it was the actions of the unified Russian/Tatar army to protect borders and suppress rebellions that were "inflated" beyond recognition.
