          Here is one of the many paintings on the theme of the battle of the Russian regiments with the Tatar-Mongol. Guess who's here where. Surprisingly, outwardly, both sides fighting look exactly the same ... as we traditionally represent
          imagine Russian knights and heroes. How is this possible? And was there a Tatar-Mongol invasion in Russia at all, or was this "historical construction" only invented by historians much later for a convenient explanation of completely different
          events and processes?
        </p>
        <p>
          A few years ago, such a question would have caused wild bewilderment, however, today, when more and more researchers are beginning to question the Tatar-Mongolian hypothesis, it is emotionally easier for us to make an effort and analyze
          pure facts, without burdening them with established interpretations, in which a series of "authorities" endlessly refer to each other, as if this in itself proves something. After all, if someone for a very long time considered some kind of lie to be true, it is from this
          it doesn't get any truer.

          <h3>1. Genetics</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          Let's start with the latest discoveries in the field of dna genealogy. By itself, it does not interpret or interpret anything, but simply shows the geographical distribution of various haplogroups (that is, common dna markers that are transmitted by
          male Y chromosome from father to son continuously up to the most distant common ancestor).
          <br>
          So, according to these studies, among our compatriots (in this case we are talking about the Central part of Russia, where the main Old Russian cities were located), speakers of Slavic, Baltic, Celto-Germanic languages are represented,
          Scandinavian, Caucasian, Semitic and some other haplogroups (in descending order).
          <br>
          But traditionally Asian haplogroups on the territory of the European part of Russia are represented in a percentage tending to <strong>ZERO</strong>. In other words â€” no trace! Which would be absolutely incredible in the case of a 300-year-old
          the domination of steppe nomads in our territories. On this, in general, the question of the Tatar-Mongol yoke can be closed, but there are other arguments.

          <h3>2. Language</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          There are absolutely <strong>no borrowings from Mongolian in the Russian language </strong>. Despite the fact that the interpenetration of words is observed even among all neighboring peoples, not to mention cases when someone conquers the territory for several centuries.
        </p>

          <h3>3. Official papers</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
        In the archives <strong>There are no documents written in Mongolian</strong> that would somehow confirm the nature of the relationship between our peoples in those very times. Only <strong>a couple of labels on the reign</strong> have been preserved, and they were found only in the XIX century in Western archives and there are <strong>great doubts about their authenticity</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
        The language of these letters, however, is also not completely clearâ€¦ In general, there is no question of any mass dissemination of the Mongolian or Tatar languages in the office work in Russia â€” no decrees, no letters â€” nothing. The same Arabic was much more widespread, which is explained by trade issues. For example, the well-known Afanasy Nikitin in his "Walking across 3 seas" constantly switches from Russian to Arabic and back in the order of things.

            <h3>4. The appearance of the Tatar-Mongols</h3>
        </center>
        <p>It is interesting to pay attention to <strong>portraits of Batu, Tamerlane and other khans</strong>. Do you think they are Mongoloids? Turkish, Arab and many other sources do not think so â€” openly portraying and describing them as Caucasians. A contemporary of the Mongol wars, the Persian historian Rashid al-Din writes that in Genghis Khan's family, children "were born mostly with gray eyes and blond hair." The chroniclers describe Batu's appearance in similar terms: fair-haired, light-bearded, light-eyed.</p>

        </center>
        <p>
          Interestingly, when Tamerlane's grave was <strong>opened in the USSR</strong> and scientists reconstructed his appearance from the skull â€” he <strong>turned out to be "too European"</strong>, <strong>therefore, Asian features were deliberately given to him</strong> so that the result corresponded to the established in public imagination of the picture.

          <h3>5. Supplies, Infrastructure and Control</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          Let's say the great Golden Horde did exist. Just imagine â€” it <strong> appeared completely "out of nowhere", having no prerequisites for this either in terms of infrastructure or even in terms of writing </strong>. And at once conquered half the world from the Asian steppes to Europe, and then for several centuries it maintained this status quo. Variations of the question "how" are endless and there are no answers to them:
          <ul>
            <li>
              how were they able to <strong> provide their many thousands of troops</strong> (according to some estimates up to 500 thousand people) such a <strong> volume of swords, shields, arrows and other weapons, without having a solid blacksmithing and mining base</strong>? Or did they buy it all from the Russians, and then went to fight with them? Well, let's say you bought it in India or China, but for what? What could they offer in return other than horses?
            </li>
            <li>
              how did they <strong> supply their army with food without farming, without having permanent arable land</strong>, without roads for the passage of carts with provisions? Such a huge cavalry army simply tramples down the grass on its way, so it cannot, in principle, stay on the footstoolâ€¦
            </li>
            <li>
              Today, some historians say that there were not 500 thousand people in the Horde at all, but only 30 thousand people. Good (which does not cancel the previous questions). But in this case <strong>how did they ensure control over the conquered territories</strong>? One must think that the situation was tense throughout the "front line", because the conquerors are not greeted with joy anywhere. But we are talking about thousands of kilometers â€” almost the whole continent. Any army would disperse and simply dissolve in these squares and would not be able to be present everywhere at the same time, suppressing riots and uprisings.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, <strong>in the XVI century, it took about 50 years for the Cossacks to "conquer Siberia"</strong> â€” to fight several thousand kilometers to Baikal, leaving behind a chain of fortified prisons. At the same time, unlike the Tatar-Mongols, they already had a strong centralized state behind them, which supplied them with all the necessary resources, and they met with rather weak resistance. The Tatar-Mongols, a couple of centuries before, allegedly went the same way in the opposite direction in just a couple of decades, conquering much more economically developed countries.

          <h3>6. Population</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          The current population of Mongolia is about 1 million people. According to the global trend, the population is usually growing, which means that in the past, it was much less than this figure. At the same time, it is known that at least 1 million people already lived in Russia at that time, and the Slavs were considered skilled warriors, who, for example, were willingly taken into service in Byzantium. It turns out that there is a discrepancy in terms of the opposing forces.

          <h3>7. Flourishing of culture, fraternity, selective approach and absence of material traces</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          And here are some more interesting questions from the "why" series:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            why <strong>did the invaders not plant their culture anywhere</strong> (by the way, no one really knows what it was) and were extremely loyal to any local religions professed by the population?
          </li>
          <li>
            why <strong> did architecture, icon painting, and many other spheres of art flourish in Russia under the yoke</strong>? Was the situation favorable and there was nothing more important on the agenda?
          </li>
          <li>
            why did these so-called "strong" Tatar-Mongols not burn all the cities in a row on their way, but captured only certain ones, and left others untouched behind their troops going on a punitive campaign?
          </li>
          <li>
            why did the Russian princes constantly have relations with the Tatar-Mongols, and vice versa, as if there was no confrontation, conquest, shameful tribute? By the way, the Tatar-Mongols were not related to the European nobility.
          </li>
          <li>
            why <strong>did the Tatar-Mongols care so much about the administrative order in Russia</strong>? Batu's invasion takes place in the midst of internecine wars and he seems to purposefully come to Russia in order to streamline the mechanism of succession to the throne and stop separatist sentiments. For example, during the Western campaigns against Europe, nothing like this happens â€” the Horde burns and plunders cities, but it does not introduce any labels on the reign and does not build a vertical of power.
          </li>
          <li>
            and finally, why is there no evidence of great conquests in the <strong> Mongol sources proper</strong>? As well as there are no tangible traces of this empire in principle â€” so, the famous center of the Horde, the city of Karakorum, has not yet been found by archaeologists.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>8. Composition of troops</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          And here are some more interesting facts in the general mosaic from our European friends â€” <strong> the Hungarian king describes the composition of the Horde</strong> as follows: "When the state of Hungary from the Mongol invasion, as from the plague, for the most part, was turned into a desert, and as a sheepfold was surrounded by various tribes of infidels, namely: <strong>by the Russians, the wanderers from the east</strong>, the Bulgarians and other heretics from the south..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingâ€¦ Russians and Brodniks (they are also Cossacks) willingly and in large numbers enlisted in the army of their conqueror and continued his campaigns? And where were the Mongols themselves at that time?
        </p>

        <center>
          <h3>9. Cossacks</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          In a way, <strong>the predecessors of the Cossacks can be considered the aforementioned Brodnikov</strong>, who lived in the same geographical area. Evidence of them as military units has been known since the XIIâ€“XIII centuries. There are also direct indications that they met foreign travelers at Batu's headquarters. However, <strong>there is absolutely no evidence that the Cossack hunters ever clashed with the Tatar-Mongols</strong>. How could they get into central Russia or Europe, bypassing the "Cossack" outposts?

          <h3>10. Traces of Tartary on maps</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, <strong> in most European languages, Tatars are known with the letter P as Tartars</strong> (remember at least the meat in Tatar - Tartar meat â€” and the tartar sauce of the same name), and only <strong> we have an extra letter somewhere disappeared</strong>. And now compare this with <strong>hundreds of maps that just scream about Tartary</strong>, and its territories do not coincide at all with the intended field of action of the Horde. <strong>The main cities of this power</strong>, according to the maps, were <strong> located in the Far East, and for example the Arctic Ocean is called the Tartar Sea</strong>. According to the maps, European Russia (under the name Moscow Tartary), and vast territories of Central Asia, India and China (Independent and Chinese Tartary) were included in Tartary. By the way, in India, which just corresponds to the location of Independent Tartary, some Great Moguls strangely consonant with the Mongols ruled at the specified timeâ€¦

          <h3>The concept of the horde</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          The words "army" and "army" were already strengthened in the Russian language under Peter, and before that <strong> any army</strong> was generally called <strong>a horde</strong> - "Swedish horde", "German horde", "Zalessky horde"... Subsequently, this concept remained with the Cossacks. And what if the word "horde" is taken literally, in its original meaning â€” simply as an army? It turns out that the whole history of a certain yoke is just the actions of the unified Russian/Tartar army, inflated beyond recognition, to protect borders and suppress rebellions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then everything falls into place â€” both taxes for the maintenance of the army from the cities (tribute), and the national composition of the "Mongolian" army, and the usual course of life of ordinary people, and the tolerance of the "invaders" to local culture and religion, and the issues of supplying the army with weapons and food, and concern for the establishment of a strong centralized government, and marriages with Russian princes, and indifference to the European nobility, and the absence of traces of Mongolian culture and civilization on our landsâ€¦
        </p>
        <hr>
        <center>
          <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        </center>
        <p>
          Today, when so many facts and arguments have accumulated against the existence of the Tatar-Mongol yoke as such, it is probably impossible to consider it anything other than a myth, a historical mistake or an intentional forgery. <strong>The stability of this myth is explained only by its wide dissemination and the unwillingness of many people to accept the information that not all "well-known truths" are so unshakable. Apologists of the Tatar-Mongol yoke usually oppose the above arguments only with emotionally irritated exclamations from the series "it can't be, because it's impossible," after which they shy away from a discussion based on logic and facts. Well, everyone is free to choose what to believe. We have only collected in this article a number of facts, questions and hypotheses that deserve attention, without claiming to be the ultimate truth.
