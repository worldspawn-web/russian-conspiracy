          <strong>Russian conspiracy theory </strong>, contrary to popular opinion, is extremely rich and has been replenished for many centuries. <strong>Brownies, gnomes, forest spirits, water spirits, goblins</strong> are all more than the ancient folklore of Russian culture, which from stories, legends and theories has turned into an integral part of culture.
          <p>
            As for modern Russian conspiracy theory, as well as the conspiracy of Soviet times, then everything is not as clear as it may seem at first glance. The fact is that with the development of the Internet system, anyone who wanted an opportunity opened up to an unlimited amount of information that could not only be absorbed, but also replenished. Naturally, they were not always replenished with reliable evidence. Either they were controversial, or they didn't exist at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, a huge number of different theories of different quality have accumulated, which need to be manually processed and sorted.

            And so this project was formed. The project is absolutely non-commercial, works for free and does not imply true information.
